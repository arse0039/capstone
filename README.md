# Audio Genre Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the genre of songs found on YouTube using audio files and neural network models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the genre of a given song. The model utilizes audio features extracted from the songs to train a neural network.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- frontend: This directory houses all of the code for the frontend web application.
- backend: This directory houses all of the code for our machine learning model, data preprocessing, route handling, REST API, and processing of youTube audio files for prediction.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the following command:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/osucapstone/capstone.git`

## Setting Up the Environment

- Frontend Setup: Details about setting up the frontend can be found in the frontEnd/README.md file.
- Backend Setup: Navigate to the backEnd/README.md file for instructions on setting up the backend, including installing dependencies, preparing the dataset, and training the model.
